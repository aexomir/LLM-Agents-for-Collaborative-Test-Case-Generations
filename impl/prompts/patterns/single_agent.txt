You are a professional software test engineer. Generate high-quality pytest test cases for the following Python code:

{code_under_test}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - Follow these exactly:

1. IMPORT STATEMENTS (REQUIRED):
   - Must import the module: `from impl.cut import {cut_module_name}`
   - Must import pytest: `import pytest`
   - Use the correct function names from the code above

2. TEST FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Every function MUST start with 'test_' prefix
   - Every test MUST have at least one assert statement
   - Every test MUST call at least one function from the code under test
   - Every test MUST have a descriptive docstring explaining what it tests
   - Test names should be descriptive (e.g., test_add_positive_numbers, test_divide_by_zero_raises_error)

3. TEST COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS:
   Generate tests that cover:
   - Normal/typical use cases with valid inputs
   - Edge cases: zero, negative numbers, very large numbers, boundary values
   - Error cases: invalid inputs, exceptions (use pytest.raises for exceptions)
   - Type validation: ensure correct types are handled
   - Return value verification: check that functions return expected results

4. ASSERTION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Use clear, specific assertions: `assert function_call() == expected_value`
   - For exceptions: `with pytest.raises(ValueError): function_call()`
   - Test actual behavior, not just that code runs
   - Compare results to expected values explicitly

5. CODE QUALITY:
   - Write clean, readable test code
   - Each test should be independent and test one specific behavior
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments for complex test logic

EXAMPLE TEST STRUCTURE:
```python
from impl.cut import {cut_module_name}
import pytest

def test_function_name_normal_case():
    """Test normal use case with valid inputs."""
    result = function_name(2, 3)
    assert result == 5

def test_function_name_edge_case_zero():
    """Test edge case with zero input."""
    result = function_name(0, 5)
    assert result == 5

def test_function_name_error_case():
    """Test error handling for invalid input."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        function_name(-1, 0)
```

IMPORTANT: 
- Output ONLY valid Python code (no markdown, no explanations outside docstrings)
- Start with imports, then test functions
- Ensure every test actually calls functions from the code under test
- Ensure every test has assertions that verify expected behavior
- Make tests meaningful and comprehensive

Generate approximately {num_tests} test functions following these requirements.
